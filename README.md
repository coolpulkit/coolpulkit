### Hi there 👋
I am Pulkit Goyal. I consider myself as a smart worker and determined team player looking to solve real world problems. I am an experienced developer skilled in C++, Java, Android Development, Full Stack Development, MEAN, MERN, Javascript and its frameworks.
I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as publicly as possible. 

### 👨‍ What Do I Do 

✔️I'm a fast learner looking for interesting career opportunities in Android and Web as a full-stack developer. I am awaiting a job with a decent salary and more importantly, a chance to build up my career and skills. I am looking for growth. Currently, I am looking for internships and research projects in the field of Computer science and engineering.

✔️My activities are much beyond my stream of education. I am involved in a lot of organizational works in college related to clubs, fests and workshops and helped in building many communities from scratch. Apart from this, I love the marketing and stocks field. I am a keen observer and always inquisitive to learn new things. I fit beautifully to the environment and add to the diversity of the team and research has shown that diversity often makes for better, most successful teams.

### My Digital Footprints 🌱
